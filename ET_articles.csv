‘However stringent PMLA is… sick and infirm can be granted bail’: Supreme Court,"The Supreme Court said on Monday those who are sick and infirm can be granted bail under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) while granting interim bail to an accused in a money laundering case.
Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud made the observations while granting interim bail to Amar Sadhuram Mulchandani, 67, former chairperson of Seva Vikas Co-operative Bank who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on the charge of money laundering on July 1, 2023, based on the predicate offence.
“However stringent PMLA is, as judges we have to operate in the four corners of the law. Law tells us that someone who is sick and infirm be granted bail. That he could be treated at a government hospital is no answer to what the statute says. Sick or infirm means you can be granted bail,” said CJI Chandrachud while presiding over a three-judge bench.

“Proviso to sec 45 (1) of PMLA specifically contemplates that a person who ‘is sick or infirm’ may be released on bail if the special court so directs. Based on the medical evaluation, which has been provided by the medical team at the Sir Grant Medical College and Sir J J Group of Hospitals, Mumbai, it is evident that the petitioner fulfils the threshold required for being enlarged on bail,” the bench also comprising Justices J B Pardiwala and Manoj Misra said in its order.
The Bombay High Court dismissed Mulchandani’s second application for grant of bail on medical grounds on August 9 this year. He then approached the Supreme Court which issued notice on September 2, 2024. On October 4, the Supreme Court directed that a fresh medical evaluation of the petitioner be conducted by the team at Sir Grant Medical College and Sir JJ Group of Hospitals, Mumbai. The evaluation was done by a team of four experts and a report was submitted to the court.
Appearing for Mulchandani, Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi said he was suffering from chronic kidney disease and could not perform daily activities while being incarcerated.
Senior Advocate Atmaram Nadkarni, who also represented Mulchandani, pointed out that there were four FIRs against the accused by ED for tampering and destroying evidence and urged the bench to give him liberty to move a court without waiting for the prosecuting agency to make a move if anything like that happens in future.",https://indianexpress.com/article/india/supreme-court-stringent-pmla-sick-and-infirm-can-be-granted-bail-9619702/
"‘Shooters set off firecracker, then fired on him indiscriminately,’ says cop part of Baba Siddique’s security","The killing of Baba Siddique was meticulously planned, and the conspirators had a clear idea that the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader had security cover, police sources said on Monday.
Siddique, a three-time former MLA and former Maharashtra minister, was coming out of his son and Bandra East MLA Zeeshan Siddique’s office and walking to his car when the three shooters fired six or seven rounds at him on Saturday night. He sustained multiple serious injuries and was rushed to Lilavati Hospital, where he was pronounced dead during treatment.
According to a head constable of the Mumbai police who was part of his security detail, one of the three shooters who carried out the contract killing of Baba Siddique set off a smoke firecracker to distract the policemen. Shyam Magan Sonawane, 47, said in his statement to the police that while they were momentarily distracted, the shooters opened fire and killed Siddique.

“When I asked Siddique’s vehicle’s driver Sharma to bring the vehicle ahead (while he was leaving after attending a meeting), one of the accused cracked a firecracker-like item. Because of this, smoke spread around (us). My eyes experienced irritation and were secreting tears. I thought someone had cracked a firecracker (in a festival celebration). This was when the assailants opened fire on Siddique indiscriminately,” said Sonawane in his statement.
Sonawane is also the complainant in the First Information Report (FIR) filed by the Mumbai police at the Nirmal Nagar police station. The statement of another policeman who was posted in Baba Siddique’s security was also recorded.
The Mumbai police have arrested three men in the case: the shooters Gurmail Singh and Dharmaraj Kashyap, and co-conspirator Pravin Lonkar. The killing was suspected to have been carried out by the gang of Lawrence Bishnoi, who is currently imprisoned at Sabarmati Central Prison in Gujarat.
A member of the gang and suspected key conspirator, Shubham Lonkar, claimed responsibility for the murder in a social media post through his account ‘shubuu lonkar’. He is currently absconding. One of the arrested accused, Pravin Lonkar, is Shubham Lonkar’s brother.Advertisement
Two more men, identified as Shivkumar Gautam and Mohamed Zeeshan Akhtar, are wanted in the case. While Gautam was one of the three shooters in Bandra, Akhtar was believed to have received the contract to murder Siddique.

Violence erupts in Bengal over photos during Durga Puja celebrations,"Violence broke out in West Bengal’s Howrah district on Sunday over a picture made during a drawing competition during a Durga Puja celebration, prompting authorities to deploy the Rapid Action Force (RAF) and impose prohibitory orders.
Swati Bhangalia, Superintendent of Police, Howrah, said a complaint was filed by a community regarding the objectionable picture, after which the police registered a case and arrested a few people. “In the Howrah district, unrest broke out during a Durga Puja celebration over a picture. The community objected to it and they came to the police station to submit a deputation. The deputation was received and a complaint was taken. Accordingly, a case was filed and arrests were also made. However, a section of them attacked the police, who retaliated and made more arrests,” said Bhangalia.
Bhangalia said the situation was under control and that strict action would be taken against anyone attempting to disrupt the peace. She also urged the public to maintain communal harmony.

"Pawan Kalyan and the changing shades of white, grey and saffron","In June, soon after he was sworn in as Deputy Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, actor-turned-politician Pawan Kalyan made a special request to Prime Minister Narendra Modi who was on the star-studded dais. Walking past CM Chandrababu Naidu and his son and minister Nara Lokesh, Modi and Kalyan headed towards a beaming Chiranjeevi – Telugu mega star and Kalyan’s brother. The three then held hands and raised them, facing a cheering crowd of onlookers.
In retrospect, that moment stands out – in the four months since then, the ‘Power Star’, as Kalyan is known in film circles, has traded his white attire for shades of saffron. On October 3, dressed similarly, he declared to a crowd at Tirupati, “I am a Sanatani Hindu”, and pledged to sacrifice his life for the religion.
While his supporters cheered his hour-long speech – where he switched between Tamil, English and Telugu – his critics point out that up until five years ago, Pawan Kalyan was a “Che Guevara fan”. His Jana Sena Party (JSP), which he founded in 2014, was then in an alliance with the Left and BSP.

With his fans urging him to play the role of Che Guevara, Kalyan would speak what political observer Ramesh Kandula calls “Marxist jargon”. While JSP insiders admit a change from that, they insist at least one part of Kalyan hasn’t changed over three decades – he has, they say, remained a champion of the Telugu middle class.
“He has experienced middle class life and its tribulations. His early years have shaped him,” Ajay Kumar, JSP spokesperson, told The Indian Express.

Kalyan was born in 1971 to a Prohibition and Excise Department official of the then united Andhra government, Konidala Venkata Rao, and Anjana Devi. A turning point in the lives of this middle-class family would be when Chiranjeevi, Kalyan’s eldest brother, made it big in the film industry.
Chiranjeevi’s stardom also catapulted his brothers Nagendra Babu and Kalyan, the youngest, onto the silver screen. But Kalyan chose his films – about 25 of them – carefully. “In his films, he was always the underdog who rose to save the day. Alongside, he built a vibrant and outspoken personality which attracted especially the young,” a Telugu film critic who did not want to be named says.Advertisement
Kalyan’s political entry appears to have been as planned. In 2008, he floated ‘Common Man Protection Force’, which was largely a platform for his fans. But its formation coincided with Chiranjeevi making a political entry with his Praja Rajyam Party (PRP). Kalyan later helmed the youth wing of the PRP.
But the PRP did not make much of a dent in Andhra politics and later merged with the Congress. “Kalyan was not a supporter of the Congress and he stayed away,” says Ajay Kumar.
In 2014, the same year as the Congress-led UPA government went through with the bifurcation of Andhra, Kalyan launched his own political party – the JSP. His anti-Congressism meant “he was one of the first celebrities to support Narendra Modi”, Kumar says. JSP insiders say that at this time, Kalyan also supported the TDP, but in 2019, when Naidu’s party joined hands with the Congress, he decided to support the Left.
Both the TDP and the JSP, however, failed to make a dent in the 2019 polls, with the YSR Congress Party sweeping both the Assembly and Lok Sabha elections in the state. Kalyan lost both the seats he contested from.Advertisement
Ahead of the 2024 polls, Kalyan took another U-turn and was instrumental in bringing together the BJP and TDP. JSP insiders say that even at a time when YSR chief Jagan Mohan Reddy and his welfare measures were being touted as a winning ticket, Kalyan was sure an NDA alliance could oust the YSRCP from power.
“Kalyan was the key element who brought not just the BJP and TDP together, but also the Kapus and Kammas (the two dominant castes of Andhra),” says Kandula.

Kalyan’s gamble was successful, with the TDP-JanaSena-BJP alliance winning 165 of the 175 seats in the Assembly. The JSP won all the 21 seats it contested from.
As Kalyan now veering seemingly even more to the right, especially in light of the Tirupati controversy, a source attributes it the JSP leader’s astuteness in gauging that the state has not yet seen a consolidation of Hindu votes in favour of the BJP – and spotting an opportunity in it for himself. “Kalyan knows that he is the right person to capitalise on the Hindu sentiment, in a way Chandrababu Naidu cannot because of his ‘secular’ credentials,” a source says.Advertisement
Apart from declaring himself a true Sanatani Hindu, Kalyan has spoken about “unification of Hindus”, as well as expressed concern about “desecration of temples and idols”, “dilution of rituals and traditions”, and “attack on the Hindu way of life”. “You may hate Modiji but do not talk negatively about the Ayodhya Temple or Lord Shri Ram,’’ he has said.
Some compare what Kalyan is attempting to what B S Yediyurappa did in Karnataka. “Yediyurappa had a south Indian version of Hindutva where he did caste engineering and also batted for a Hindu way of life,” a source from Vijayawada points out.
Those in the JSP are also at pains to point out that Kalyan’s definition of Sanatana Dharma is distinct from the BJP’s. Party leader Dr P Hari Prasad says Kalyan has always been a religious person. “He has been undertaking fasts and deekshas since childhood… It is not that he has suddenly become a champion of Sanatan Dharma… And Pawan Kalyan respects all religions. If a mosque or a church invites him, he goes too. He is of the opinion that people should show the same respect to Hinduism.”
Adds TDP leader Anam Venkat Reddy: “Lord Balaji holds a very special place in the lives of Telugu people. He is an emotion. Pawan Kalyan, like Chandrababu Naidu, feels very strongly about the entire (Tirupati) controversy.”Advertisement
Sources in both the JSP and TDP also believe that Kalyan’s Sanatan Dharma remarks, including his attack on DMK leader Udhayanidhi as a part of them, could see him help the BJP and AIADMK get back together in Tamil Nadu. “Taking a jibe at DMK chief M K Stalin’s son for his remarks on Sanatana Dharma definitely looks like the start of something,’’ a JSP leader says.
While Kalyan could not be reached despite several attempts, other JSP insiders say his new persona post the laddoo row in Tirupati is also partly because the Deputy CM has been on “deeksha” since he took office. “He is wearing saffron because he was first on a chaturmasa (four-month) deeksha. Later, after the laddu controversy broke, he took up penance and wore saffron,” says a party leader.
His teeming fans and supporters across south India are, for one, convinced he is on the right path – one that will lead Kalyan right to the CM’s post. “We worked so much for the JSP during the 2024 elections and will not rest till the ‘Power Star’ becomes CM,” says Murali Gowda, the president of the Power Star Pawan Kalyan Fans’ Association in Karnataka.
There is a significant obstacle though in these ambitions: Old Andhra Pradesh warhorse Naidu’s own aspirations regarding son Nara Lokesh.

Opinion | Has the Modi government pursued Patel's thinking in its Pakistan policy?,"External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar delivered the Sardar Patel Memorial Lecture on Governance on October 5. It received far less media attention than it deserved because of the elections in Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir. Jaishankar raised significant issues concerning Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s contribution to the making of modern India as well as the contemporary relevance of his ideas on administration and governance, foreign policy, economic management and choices, and the ideological orientations of the Indian state. All these areas required sober, objective and scholarly treatment. Jaishankar is erudite and capable of unbiased assessments of Patel’s great work in the early years of India’s Independence while avoiding the trap of his party’s determination to project the Sardar favourably while denigrating Jawarharlal Nehru. Sadly, Jaishankar chose not to sidestep the trap.
Jaishankar was right in focusing on Patel’s skills as an administrator and his undoubted nationalism and realism. He correctly highlighted Patel’s great work in integrating India. The British put the poisoned pill of declaring Indian princely states independent in the Indian Independence Act of 1947. That legislation created the dominions of India and Pakistan and transferred power to Indian hands in August 1947, leading to the creation of Pakistan. My grandfather, Kailas Nath Katju, who served as a senior member of Nehru’s Cabinet, notes in an unpublished biography, “Settlement with the Indian Princes was indeed the very first problem which confronted the new Government right from the start, and was settled in a wonderful astute manner by Sardar Patel [who] was definitely the architect of the magnificent structure which we now call Bharat”. This demonstrates that Nehru’s colleagues fully recognised Patel’s enormous contribution to India’s integration.
On Patel’s contribution to India’s governance structures, Jaishankar notes, “It is to the credit of Sardar Patel that he stood up strongly for the continuity of our governance, whether it was our bureaucratic or military institutions and their practices”. Here too grandfather’s biography offers an insight on an issue which is perhaps not widely known. Grandfather strongly felt that the US political system was better suited to Indian conditions. As a member of the Constituent Assembly’s committee on state governments which was chaired by Patel, grandfather proposed that governors should be directly elected through adult franchise. This proposal was accepted in a joint meeting of the Central Government Committee chaired by Nehru and the Provincial Government Committee. Grandfather then proposed that provincial ministers should be responsible to governors instead of the legislature. Patel rejected it outright.

Grandfather writes, “He said during the last 150 years, ever since the beginning of the British Rule in India, we had become wedded to British ways of thought in the political sphere, and we looked upon our own Houses of Legislature as being the counter-parts of the British House of Commons in India, and it was unthinkable to refuse to entrust this power our own Houses of Legislature”. If this was the case then it was pointless for the governor to be directly elected and this is what the Constituent Assembly decided. At a time when national stability was the first priority, Patel’s political instincts and his decision to continue with the colonial origin of civil service and military were also correct. But, as Jaishankar, has speculated on Patel’s views on decisions taken in many spheres after his demise, it would be legitimate to ask: Would he have wished that our present administrative and some aspects of our military structures with their roots in colonialism should continue even now?
Jaishankar has reiterated the Sangh Parivar’s deeply held view that Patel would have handled the J&K issue as well as he did the Hyderabad and Junagadh matters. Certainly, India’s approaching the United Nations on J&K was wrong under any article of the Charter. This writer personally knows that Nehru admitted to Tej Bahadur Sapru, within a few months of going to the UN, that a mistake had been made. However, it is best to leave to historians to debate what were Patel’s views on J&K, at least, in the early months of Independence. Yes, “Patelian” realism should always be a guide in dealing with Pakistan as in handling other foreign and security policy issues. It should have been so in the case of the Indus Waters Treaty too. But the siren song of good relations with Pakistan has lured many Indian Prime Ministers. Indeed, Jaishankar knows this well for he oversaw events, as Foreign Secretary, in the India-Pakistan relations in 2015-2016. It would be therefore legitimate to ask: Were Patel’s lessons on realism pursued by the Modi government during these years in its Pakistan policy?
Patel’s caution on China was also correct. The nation has paid a heavy price for Nehru’s idealism in dealing with China. Even if India did not have the instruments to thwart the Chinese in Tibet, it need not have formally accepted what the Chinese did to Tibet. Jaishankar is also absolutely correct when he emphasises, “the importance of getting the right assessment of the relevant situation. This is a key aspect of governance. Because, if we start with a misdiagnosis, everything else thereafter only takes us in the wrong direction”. It would be useful to get a clarification from Jaishankar on India’s diagnosis of Chinese approaches towards India in the years 2014-2020. Was there a misdiagnosis and, if so, by whom?
Jaishankar is perhaps right that Patel would not have favoured “socialist” socio-economic policies. But as a staunch Gandhian for whom simplicity, in every aspect of life, was an article of faith, was he not entirely comfortable with the egalitarianism propounded in the Constitution’s Directive Principles of State Policy? Would he not have been appalled at the blatant display of wealth by the nation’s uber-rich and growing disparities in India?

"Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James A Robinson win Nobel Economics Prize","The Nobel Memorial Prize in economics was awarded to Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James A Robinson for their research into differences in prosperity between nations.
The three awardees “have demonstrated the importance of societal institutions for a country’s prosperity”, the Nobel committee of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said, adding, “Societies with a poor rule of law and institutions that exploit the population do not generate growth or change for the better. The laureates’ research helps us understand why.”
The award was announced in Stockholm on Monday.
Acemoglu and Johnson work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology while Robinson is a researcher at the University of Chicago.
