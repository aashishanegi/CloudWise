"Activists sell 'farewell tour' merch before King's visitSatirical posters, T-shirts and beer coasters urge Australians to ""wave goodbye to royal reign"".9 hrs agoAustralia","The Australian Republican Movement (ARM) has launched a campaign branding King Charles's upcoming visit to the country as the ""farewell tour"" of the British monarchy.They say the tongue-in-check push - which includes a merchandise collection - is aimed at sparking debate about the role of the Crown in modern Australia, but monarchists say it is offensive. The tour, from 18 to 26 October, marks the first royal visit down under in more than a decade and will be King Charles's longest trip since his cancer diagnosis. It also comes a year after Australia's unsuccessful Voice to Parliament vote, which has stalled momentum for another referendum. Referendums are the only way to change Australia's constitution and have an 80% failure rate.The nation held one on the question of becoming a republic once before in 1999, which failed, however public support for the movement has grown since then.On satirical posters, T-shirts, beer coasters and other paraphernalia, ARM's campaign depicts the King, Queen and Prince of Wales as aging rock stars and urges Australians ""young and old"" to ""wave goodbye to royal reign"".""We expect a full-time, fully committed head of state whose only allegiance is to us – a unifying symbol at home and abroad,"" the movement's Co-Chair Esther Anatolitis said in a statement on Monday.""It’s time for Australia to say ‘thanks, but we’ve got it from here’,"" she added.The organisation cited research it commissioned suggesting 92% of Australians are either ""supporters of a republic"" or ""open to it"", as well as a finding that at least 40% of people surveyed didn't know the country's head of state was a foreign monarch.Independent polling paints a different picture though, with one survey suggesting that roughly 35% of people want to remain a constitutional monarchy.The Australian Monarchist League (AML) has described the ARM polling as ""inflated"", while also criticising its new campaign as ""terribly disrespectful to Charles given his ongoing cancer battle"". ""He should be applauded for his bravery, not insulted,” National Chairman Philip Benwell said. Australia's Prime Minister is a long-term republican but his government put any plans to hold a vote on breaking away from the British monarchy on ice earlier this year, saying it was no longer a priority issue.Over the weekend, King Charles confirmed he had exchanged letters with the ARM ahead of his visit, reiterating the palace's longstanding policy that it was up to Australians to make decisions about their future. Constitutional votes in Australia are rare and difficult to pass, requiring a 'double majority' - support from more than half of the nation overall, and a majority in at least four of its six states. Only eight of 44 referendums have succeeded and almost all had bipartisan support.The Voice referendum - which would have recognised First Nations people in the constitution and allowed them to form a body to advise the parliament - was overwhelmingly rejected after a bruising debate.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0evznvvvko
"Man with guns arrested near Trump rally, then releasedThis is the third time someone with firearms has been either arrested or shot after being spotted near Trump.32 mins agoUS & Canada","A man in illegal possession of a shotgun and a loaded handgun was arrested at an intersection near Donald Trump's rally in Coachella, California, on Saturday, police said. The 49-year-old suspect, Vem Miller, was driving a black SUV when he was stopped at a security checkpoint by officers, who located the two firearms and a ""high-capacity magazine"". Mr Miller was then taken into custody ""without incident"", the Riverside County Sheriff's office said. He was later released and told US media he was a Trump supporter who was not planning to harm the Republican presidential candidate.The US Secret Service said Trump “was not in any danger”, and that the incident did not impact protective operations.  Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco also said that the encounter did not affect the safety of Trump or the rally's attendees. Although it was impossible to speculate about what was in the mind of the suspect, Mr Bianco said he ""truly believed"" that his officers had prevented a third assassination attempt.He added that it might be impossible to prove that this was the intent of Mr Miller, who he described as ""a lunatic"". Mr Bianco is an elected official and a Republican who has previously expressed support for Trump. He is also acting as a surrogate - a representative - for Trump's re-election campaign.Mr Miller himself told the Southern California News Group that he was ""shocked"" at his arrest, while denying accusations that he wanted to hurt Trump.He also told Fox News that he ""always"" travelled around with guns in his vehicle, but had never fired one.Before his release on a $5,000 (£3,826) bail, Mr Miller was charged with two misdemeanour weapons charges. No federal charges have been filed.A federal law enforcement official told the BBC's US partner CBS News there was no indication of an assassination attempt connected to this incident.Federal authorities say they are still investigating the incident, and it would be up to them to pursue any additional charges.  In a police news conference on Sunday, Mr Bianco gave an account of events. He said that as the suspect approached an outside perimeter, near the location of the rally, he ""gave all indications that he was allowed to be there"".But as the suspect got to the inside perimeter, ""many irregularities popped up"", Mr Bianco added, explaining that the vehicle had a fake licence plate and was in ""disarray"" inside.Multiple passports with multiple names and multiple driving licences were found in the car, the sheriff said, adding that the licence plate was ""home-made"" and not registered.He added that the licence plate was also ""indicative of a group of individuals that claim to be Sovereign Citizens"", an anti-government movement. In his comments to US media, Mr Miller denied being a member. First Trump assassination attempt: An hour that shook the US electionSecond attempt: Ryan Routh charged over incident in Florida The incident - which police said took place at 16:59 local time on Saturday (00:59 GMT on Sunday) - highlights, once again, the intense security operation around Trump, and the dangers facing the former president, with just over three weeks to go until the election.It follows two high-profile alleged assassination attempts on Trump earlier this year, which resulted in an increase in the security around him at events.The Saturday before Mr Miller's arrest, Trump held his second rally in Butler, Pennsylvania this year, the same place were his ear was bloodied after a sniper fired multiple shots in his direction, killing one person in the crowd.Another man is currently in jail after he was arrested outside the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach in September. The man was spotted hiding in bushes near the golf course with the muzzle of a rifle sticking out through the shrubbery.  By Shayan Sardarizadeh, BBC VerifyDespite Sheriff Bianco’s suggestion that Mr Miller was planning to kill Trump, Mr Miller’s online footprint appears to back up his statements that he actually supports the Republican presidential candidate.Content that he has posted seems to provide evidence that he is a dedicated right-wing activist.He has two profiles on Facebook - one for a state election in Nevada in 2022 – as well as an Instagram, a LinkedIn, a Twitter account and an online show on video platform Rumble.Mr Miller posted footage of himself at the Republican National Convention in July, along with photos with many high-profile Republicans and conservative commentators.He regularly attends pro-Trump rallies events around the country and appears to be strongly opposed to the Democrats.Mr Miller has also posted about a wide range of conspiracy theories around Covid, vaccines, 9/11, and the weather.He owns a website and hosts an online chat show, in which he describes himself as an investigative journalist and filmmaker. His show also promotes right-wing views alongside his apparent conspiratorial beliefs.In online posts, he has also promoted violence against Democrats for what he has called ""treason"" over the Hurricane Helene response.

China 'punishes' Taiwan president remarks with new drillsBeijing says the exercise involved all parts of the military and simulates a full-scale attack on its neighbour.42 mins agoAsia,"China on Monday launched new military drills off the coast of Taiwan in what it described as ""punishment"" for a speech given by its president William Lai, when he vowed to ""resist annexation"" or ""encroachment upon our sovereignty"".China claims the self-governing island of Taiwan as its own and its president Xi Jinping has vowed to retake it by force if necessary. Taiwan said it detected 34 naval vessels and 125 aircraft in formation around the island on Monday.Maps published by Chinese state media indicated its forces were positioned around the whole island. It said later on Monday that the drills had been successfully concluded. The Chinese military, known as the People's Liberation Army (PLA) said the drills involved all wings of the army and were designed to simulate attacking Taiwan by land, sea and air.Senior Captain Li Xi, spokesperson of the PLA Eastern Theater Command said the drills ""fully tested the integrated joint operation capabilities"" of its troops.Taiwan's airports and ports continued functioning as normal.An earlier statement from the Taiwanese defence ministry condemned the Chinese move and said its priority was to avoid direct clashes which could escalate the stand-off further. Outlying islands were put on high alert, it added. China's foreign ministry confirmed it had simulated military assaults and port blockades, and described Taiwanese independence as being ""incompatible"" with peace in the region.A post by the Chinese coast guard on its Weibo account later noted that the route of the patrol was in the shape of a heart. China has held several major military drills off the coast of Taiwan since 2022 and its fighter jets regularly enter Taiwanese airspace. The latest exercise has been dubbed Joint Sword 2024-B by Beijing and had been widely expected since May, when drills bearing the same name and officially labelled as part A were staged.That exercise, which China described as its largest yet, were timed to coincide with the inauguration of President Lai, who Beijing has long seen as a ""troublemaker"" advocating for Taiwan's independence. His latest comments, made on Taiwan's national day, were condemned by China, which said he was escalating tensions with ""sinister intentions"". But while these drills were widely expected, if you look at the deployment and how close Chinese ships and aircraft are to Taiwan - as well as the fiery rhetoric - this is very aggressive behaviour.In any other context, this would be seen as a dramatic escalation - but it comes against the backdrop of tensions that were already very high.The US reacted by saying that there was no justification for the drills after Lai's ""routine"" speech, and that China should avoid further actions which may jeopardise peace and stability in the region. The recent history of China’s military intimidation of Taiwan goes back to 1996, after Taiwan held its first direct presidential elections. China declared several areas around Taiwan off limits, and fired short-range ballistic missiles into those areas off the north and south coasts. US President Bill Clinton quietly moved US Navy forces into the Taiwan strait to demonstrate to Beijing that the US would prevent an attack on the island.Tensions eased considerably between 2008 and 2016 - until the leader of Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Tsai Ing-wen was elected as president. China considers the DPP to be a hard line pro-independence party, and responded by cutting off all direct contacts with the government in Taipei.That situation has remained ever since.In August 2022 US house speaker Nancy Pelosi flew into Taipei – the first time a sitting house speaker had visited the island since 1997. Pelosi’s visit and her open support for Taiwan was seen by Beijing as a huge provocation – coming close to a formal recognition of the government here by a very senior US politician.It reacted with fury – holding two days of exercises and for the first time ever flying ballistic missiles over the island and in to the Pacific Ocean.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgd4yn45qlo
Fighting Russia - and low morale - on Ukraine's ‘most dangerous front line’The BBC visits a key city under attack by Russia and finds eroded morale among its few remaining residents.14 hrs agoEurope,"“This is the most dangerous of all front lines,” says Oleksandr, the head of a medical unit for the Ukrainian army's 25th Brigade.We are in the treatment room of a cramped makeshift field unit - the first point of treatment for injured soldiers.“The Russian Federation is pushing very hard. We have not been able to stabilise the front. Each time the front line moves, we also move.”We are close to Pokrovsk, a small mining city about 60km (37 miles) to the north-west of the regional capital, Donetsk.The medics tell us they recently treated 50 soldiers in one day - numbers rarely seen before during the course of this war. The casualties are brought in for treatment at this secret location after dusk, when there is less of a chance of being attacked by armed Russian drones.The Ukrainian troops have been injured in the ferocious battle to defend Pokrovsk. Just months ago, this was considered a relatively safe place - home to about 60,000 people, its streets lined with restaurants, cafes and markets. Soldiers would often come from the front line to the city for a break.Now, it feels like a ghost town. More than three-quarters of its population have left. Since Russia captured the city of Avdiivka in February, the speed of its advance in the Donestk region has been swift. At the start of October, it captured the key city of Vuhledar. The Ukrainian government agrees with the soldiers we meet on the ground, that fighting around Pokrovsk is the most intense.“The Pokrovsk direction leads the number of enemy attacks,” Kyiv stated last week - claiming that, in total, the Armed Forces of Ukraine had repelled about 150 “enemy” attacks on most days in the past two weeks.In the field unit, six miles from the front, army medic Tania holds the arm of Serhii, a soldier with a bloodied bandage covering most of his face, and guides him into an examination room.“His condition is serious,” says Tania.Serhii has shrapnel injuries to one of his eyes, his skull and brain. The doctors quickly clean up his wounds and inject antibiotics. Five more soldiers arrive soon after - they are uncertain how they received their injuries. The barrage of fire can be so fierce and sudden, their wounds could have been caused by mortars or explosives dropped from drones.“It’s dangerous here. It is difficult, mentally and physically. We are all tired, but we are coping,” says Yuriy, the commander of all the brigade's medical units.All the soldiers we see were injured at different times of the morning, but they have only arrived after nightfall, when it is safer.Such delays can increase the risk of death and disability, we are told.Another soldier, Taras, has tied a tourniquet around his arm to stop the bleeding from a shrapnel wound, but now - more than 10 hours later - his arm looks swollen and pale and he can’t feel it. A doctor tells us it might have to be amputated. In the past 24 hours, two soldiers have been brought in dead.What we see at the field unit points to the ferocity of the battle for Pokrovsk - an important transport hub. The rail link that passes through was used regularly to evacuate civilians from front-line towns to safer parts of Ukraine, and to move supplies for the military.Ukraine knows what is at stake here.The threat of Russian drones is ever present - one hovers just outside the medical unit while we are there. It makes evacuations from the front line extremely hard. The building's windows are boarded up so the drones can't look inside, but the minute anyone steps out of the door, they are at risk of being hit.The drones are also a threat to the remaining citizens of Pokrovsk.“We constantly hear them buzzing - they stop and look inside the windows,” says Viktoriia Vasylevska, 50, one of the remaining, war-weary residents. But even she has now agreed to be evacuated from her home, on the particularly dangerous eastern edge of the city.She is surprised by how fast the front line has moved west towards Pokrovsk.“It all happened so quickly. Who knows what will happen here next. I’m losing my nerve. I have panic attacks. I’m afraid of the nights.”Viktoriia says she has barely any money and will have to start her life from scratch somewhere else, but it is too scary to stay here now.“I want the war to end. There should be negotiations. There is nothing left in the lands taken by Russia anyway. Everything is destroyed and all the people have fled,” she says. We find eroded morale among most of the people we speak to - the toll of more than two and a half years of a grinding war.Most of Pokrovsk is now without power and water.At a school, there is a queue of people carrying empty canisters waiting to use a communal tap. They tell us that a few days ago, four taps were working, but now they are down to just one.Driving through the streets, pockets of destruction are visible, but the city hasn’t yet been bombed out like others that have been fiercely fought over.We meet Larysa, 69, buying sacks of potatoes at one of a handful of food stalls still open at the otherwise shuttered-down central market.“I’m terrified. I can’t live without sedatives,” she says. On her small pension, she doesn't think she would be able to afford rent somewhere else. “The government might take me somewhere and shelter me for a while. But what after that?” Another shopper, 77-year-old Raisa chimes in. “You can’t go anywhere without money. So we just sit in our home and hope that this will end.”Larysa thinks it’s time to negotiate with Russia - a sentiment that might have been unthinkable for most in Ukraine some time ago. But at least here, near the front line, we found many voicing it.“So many of our boys are dying, so many are wounded. They’re sacrificing their lives, and this is going on and on,” she says.From a mattress on the floor of an evacuation van, 80-year-old Nadiia has no sympathy for the advancing Russian forces. “Damn this war! I’m going to die,” she wails. “Why does [President] Putin want more land? Doesn’t he have enough? He has killed so many people.”Nadiia can't walk. She used to drag herself around her house, relying on the help of neighbours. Just a handful of them have stayed back, but under the constant threat of bombardment, she has decided to leave even though she doesn’t know where she will go. But there are those who are not yet leaving town.Among them are locals working to repair war-damaged infrastructure.“I live on one of the streets closest to the front line. Everything is burnt out around my house. My neighbours died after their home was shelled,” Vitaliy tells us, as he and his co-workers try to fix electrical lines.“But I don’t think it’s right to abandon our men. We have to fight until we have victory and Russia is punished for its crimes.”His resolve is not shared by 20-year-old Roman, who we meet while he is working to fix a shell-damaged home.“I don’t think the territory we’re fighting for is worth human lives. Lots of our soldiers have died. Young men who could have had a future, wives and children. But they had to go to the front line.” At dawn one morning, we drive towards the battlefield outside the city. Fields of dried sunflowers line the sides of the roads. There is barely any cover, and so we drive at breakneck speed in order to protect ourselves against Russian drone attacks.We hear loud explosions as we near the front line.At a Ukrainian artillery position, Vadym fires a Soviet-era artillery gun. It emits a deafening sound and blows dust and dried leaves off the ground. He runs to shelter in an underground bunker, keeping safe from Russian retaliation and waiting for the coordinates of the next Ukrainian strike.“They [Russia] have more manpower and weapons. And they send their men onto the battlefield like they’re canon fodder,” he says.But he knows that if Pokrovsk falls, it could open a gateway to the Dnipro region - just 32km (20 miles) from Pokrovsk - and their job will become even more difficult.“Yes, we are tired - and many of our men have died and been wounded - but we have to fight, otherwise the result will be catastrophic.” Additional reporting by Imogen Anderson, Anastasiia Levchenko, Volodymyr Lozhko, Sanjay Ganguly",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80rjxl7le1o
What the stabbing of a schoolboy tells us about the dangers of Chinese nationalismThe Chinese government has been accused of using online nationalism as a useful safety valve.12 hrs agoBBC InDepth,"On a Tuesday morning in September, a 10-year-old boy was approaching the gates of a Japanese school in Shenzhen in southern China, when a stranger walked up and stabbed him.He died of his injuries. The killing shocked Japan and China, and sparked a diplomatic furore.The Japanese government said it believed what happened was motivated by xenophobia, with the country’s foreign minister blaming the attack on “malicious and anti-Japanese” social media posts.Online commentators have noted the killing happened on a politically sensitive date – 18 September, which is the anniversary of an incident that led to the Japanese occupation of Manchuria in China in the early 1930s.For some, what happened is a sign of online nationalism – manifesting in recent years as rising anti-foreigner rhetoric – spilling over into the real world.For years, posts related to events during World War Two have proliferated on the Chinese internet, with the Japanese invasion during the war remaining a sensitive topic for nationalists on both sides. In China, Japan’s wartime atrocities have long been a sore point as Beijing maintains that Tokyo has never fully apologised.The online posts are part of a wider phenomenon, which encompasses both xenophobia and attacks on Chinese nationals for being unpatriotic. One argument by analysts is that this digital nationalism has gone mostly unchecked by the Chinese government, with online patriotism fanning flames of anti-foreigner sentiment as well as accusations against Chinese figures. Some are asking if this has gone too far. They have dubbed the online attacks calling Chinese figures unpatriotic a “Cultural Revolution 2.0”, the latest in a series of drives ensuring ideological purity. They see echoes of the violent, state-sponsored campaign against so-called enemies of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) that traumatised the country in the 1960 and 1970s. Hundreds of thousands died in purges often led by youth militias known as the Red Guards. Families and neighbours turned on each other.In a recent essay, author and university professor Zhang Sheng noted that “in the past people summoned the Red Guards, now people summon the ‘little pinks’” – a popular nickname for the virtual army of online nationalists. While many on Chinese social media mourned the killing of the Japanese schoolboy, a few cyber-nationalists struck a very different tone.“I have no opinion on how Japanese die if they don’t apologise for history,” read one popular comment on Weibo, while another pointed out that the Japanese had killed many Chinese during World War Two “and haven’t apologised till this day. How could they be even close to being described as civilised?”A Chinese official reportedly wrote messages in a private group chat saying it is “not a big deal to kill a Japanese child” and “it’s in our regulations to kill Japanese”. He has since been placed under investigation, according to local media outlet Phoenix News.As Japanese officials demanded answers for the “despicable” crime, Beijing sought to play it down, heavily censoring discussion of the incident online and calling it an “accidental, individual case” and an “isolated incident”.But this is the third high-profile attack on foreigners in recent months, all of which China has described as “isolated incidents”.In June, a Japanese mother and her son were attacked at a bus stop outside a Japanese school, and a Chinese woman died while trying to shield them. This happened just weeks after four US university tutors were stabbed in a park in Jilin. While the motives for both attacks were also unclear, they spurred anxious discussion that they were linked to xenophobic rhetoric online. It is not just foreigners facing the ire of cyber-nationalists. In recent months, Chinese public figures and companies have also been castigated for being insufficiently patriotic.Beverage giant Nongfu Spring is considered a Chinese business success story, with its mineral water bottles a ubiquitous sight across the country’s convenience stores and restaurant tables. But in March, nationalists accused the company of using Japanese elements in its product design. One of its logos was said to resemble a Shinto temple, while the iconic mineral water bottle’s red cap was deemed to be a reference to the Japanese flag.It resulted in a brief but intense online campaign: some called for a boycott, while videos of people angrily stamping on Nongfu Spring bottles and chucking their drinks down the toilet were all over social media. Similarly, the author and Nobel Literature Prize laureate Mo Yan was accused of “beautifying” Japanese soldiers and being unpatriotic in his works by a nationalist blogger, who controversially sued the writer for insulting China.These moves have sparked deep concern. Hu Xijin, the former editor of state-run newspaper Global Times, warned that nationalistic attacks on creatives like Mo Yan could have a chilling effect.And the outspoken liberal intellectual Yu Jianrong said the recent stabbings of foreigners were fuelled by “dangerous populist tendencies, which deserve our utmost vigilance”.Even state media has accused online nationalists of “making patriotism a business”. One commentary by CCP mouthpiece People’s Daily said those who “stir up public opinion and add fuel to the flames in order to… gain traffic and make personal gains, should be severely punished”.But the ruling party has had a hand in stoking the fire, some say. “State-endorsed patriotism” and Beijing’s constant warnings about foreign influence has contributed to the “intense nationalism” we see today, says Rose Luqiu, an associate professor at Hong Kong Baptist University’s communication school. What has aggravated it, she says, is the legal risk of being deemed unpatriotic.The Chinese government has now criminalised the “distortion and smearing [of] heroes and martyrs” – this was used in the lawsuit against the author Mo Yan. It has also passed a sweeping anti-espionage law and launched a campaign encouraging the public to report suspicious activity by foreigners.To legitimise its rule, it has stepped up efforts to strengthen patriotism in schools, where from a young age Chinese children are taught to love not just their country but also the CCP.Meanwhile, a global surge in Sinophobic sentiment during the Covid pandemic and growing suspicion of China in the West due to trade tensions has fed a sense among some Chinese that their country is being unfairly discriminated against by foreigners.China’s slowing economy and a spreading social malaise have also played a role. “Many people in China are confronted with severe social and economic worries. Inflation, housing crises, youth unemployment, and evaporating pensions are all causing anxieties. Nationalism is a readily available and highly potent framework for venting those frustrations,” says Florian Schneider, an expert in online Chinese nationalism at Leiden University.All these factors have resulted in nationalist bloggers becoming a prominent fixture of the Chinese internet in the last few years. Well-known influencers can amass millions of followers – and potentially earn income from the traffic – by pumping out patriotic content extolling the virtues of China and the CCP while denouncing their enemies.While they often act in the name of revolutionary leftist fervour, their behaviour is actually more similar to the far right found in other countries who lead xenophobic and reactionary movements, Professor Schneider tells the BBC.As “populists who are trying to make China great again”, they “harbour hopes of returning society to some imagined former glory, and see all manner of elites and foreign powers as roadblocks to this goal”. Sometimes authorities appear to listen to concerns.In July, they quietly dropped a controversial amendment to a national security law after a public outcry. They acknowledged that a proposed ban on “hurting Chinese people’s feelings” could “infringe upon the legitimate rights and normal life of the public”.Chinese social media platforms have tried to rein in online nationalists by periodically suspending their accounts.Well-known nationalist influencers Sima Nan and Guyanmuchan have been censored without warning. So was the blogger who tried to sue Mo Yan, whose lawsuit was also rejected by the courts.One vlogger, who shot to notoriety this year after he posted a video accusing a shopping mall of putting up decorations that resembled the Japanese flag, was similarly shut down. A scathing state media commentary denounced his video as “a malicious report that rides on the online traffic of patriotism”.Still, authorities appear to have a loose grip on online nationalists.While dissenters are swiftly shut down or in some cases arrested in the name of social stability, nationalist bloggers are allowed a freer rein, despite their sometimes inflammatory rhetoric. State media has even boosted these voices by republishing their content.The BBC has asked the Chinese government for a response on why nationalist content does not appear to be censored on social media as much as other content deemed sensitive.That could be down to the fact the state views online nationalism as a useful safety valve to “dissipate dissent in a way that does not undermine its authority”, particularly during its current economic troubles, where “society really needs an outlet to express frustration”, says Dr Luqiu.By encouraging nationalists and then occasionally reining them in, the government “harnesses nationalism to its advantage, only intervening when it risks spilling over” into an uncontrollable situation.It may seem risky, but Beijing has successfully crushed serious challenges to its authority in recent years, such as the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong in 2019 and the White Paper protests in 2022 against harsh zero-Covid policies.The government is thus confident it can manage the dangers, and it means nationalism is likely to stay despite the backlash, analysts say.“Nationalism is a mixed blessing for China’s leaders, and at the moment we are witnessing the costs of that,” says Professor Schneider.“But will the leadership rethink or even abandon its nationalism in favour of something less toxic? I wouldn’t hold my breath.”Additional reporting by Ian Tang. BBC InDepth is the new home on the website and app for the best analysis and expertise from our top journalists.

Harris or Trump? What Chinese people want from US electionPeople in Beijing tell the BBC's Laura Bicker their hopes and fears about who will win the White House race.10 hrs agoWorld,"In China, people are following the US election with keen interest and some anxiety. They fear what could happen next at home and abroad, whoever wins the White House.“None of us wants to see a war,” says Mr Xiang, as the music in the park reaches a crescendo and a nearby dancer elegantly spins his partner.He has come to Ritan Park to learn dance with other seniors. They gather here regularly, just a few hundred metres from the Beijing home of the American ambassador in China.In addition to new dance moves, the looming US election is also on their minds. It comes at a pivotal time between the two superpowers, with tensions over Taiwan, trade and international affairs running high.“I am worried that Sino-US relations are getting tense,” says Mr Xiang who’s in his sixties. Peace is what we want, he adds.A crowd has gathered to listen to this conversation. Most are reluctant to give their full names in a country where it is permissible to talk about the US president, but being critical of their own leader could get them in trouble.They say they are worried about war - not just about a conflict between Washington and Beijing but an escalation of current wars in the Middle East and Ukraine.Election polls - is Harris or Trump ahead?Only one candidate is talking about ChinaThat is why Mr Meng, in his 70s, hopes Donald Trump will win the election.“Although he imposes economic sanctions on China, he does not wish to start or fight a war. Mr Biden starts more wars so more ordinary people dislike him. It is Mr Biden who supports Ukraine’s war and both Russia and Ukraine suffer great loss from the war,” he said.Some sisters recording a dance routine for their social media page chip in. “Donald Trump said in the debate that he will end the war in Ukraine 24 hours after he takes office,” says one. “About Harris, I know little about her, we think she follows the same route as President Biden who supports war.”Their opinions echo a key message being propagated on Chinese state media. China has called on the international community to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza while aligning itself with what it describes as its “Arab brothers” in the Middle East and has been quick to blame the US for its unwavering support of Israel.On Ukraine, Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the United Nations that China was playing a “constructive role” as he accused Washington of “exploiting the situation for selfish gain”.While most analysts believe Beijing does not have a favourite in this race for the White House, many would agree that Kamala Harris is an unknown quantity to Chinese people and the country’s leaders.Listen to Laura Bicker discuss China/US on The Global StoryXi Jinping has economy worries. What do Chinese people think?But some believe she will be more stable than Trump when it comes to one of the biggest flashpoints between the US and China - Taiwan.“I don’t like Trump. I don’t think there is a good future between the US and China – there are too many problems, the global economy, and also the Taiwan problem,” says a father of a four-year-old boy in the park for a family day out.He fears their differences over Taiwan could eventually lead to conflict. “I don’t want it. I don’t want my son to go to the military,” he says as the young boy pleads to go back on the slide.China claims the self-governing island of Taiwan as its own and President Xi has said “reunification is inevitable”, vowing to retake it by force if necessary.The US maintains official ties with Beijing and recognises it as the only Chinese government under its ""One China policy"" but it also remains Taiwan's most significant international supporter.Washington is bound by law to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons and Joe Biden has said that the US would defend Taiwan militarily, breaking with a stance known as strategic ambiguity.Harris has not gone that far. Instead, when asked in a recent interview she stated a “commitment to security and prosperity for all nations.”Donald Trump is instead focused on a deal - not diplomacy. He has called on Taiwan to pay for its protection.“Taiwan took our chip business from us. I mean, how stupid are we? They’re immensely wealthy,” he said in a recent interview. “Taiwan should pay us for defence.” SIMPLE GUIDE: How to win a US electionEXPLAINER: What Harris or Trump would do in powerANALYSIS: What could be the 'October Surprise'? FACT-CHECK: Debunking Trump claim about hurricane fundsVOICES: 'I'm uneasy' - first-time voters weigh in One of their biggest worries when it comes to the former US president is that he has also made it clear he plans to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese goods.This is the last thing many businesses in China want right now as the country is trying to manufacture enough goods to export itself out of an economic downturn.Ministers in China bristle with contempt at US-led trade tariffs which were first imposed by Donald Trump. President Biden has also levied tariffs, targeting Chinese electronic vehicles and solar panels. Beijing believes these moves are an attempt to curb its rise as a global economic power. “I don’t think it will do any good to the US to impose tariffs on China,” says Mr Xiang, echoing the sentiments of many we met. The tariffs will hit the US people, he adds, and increase costs for ordinary people.Many of the the younger generation, while patriotic, also look towards the US for trends and culture - and that, perhaps more than any diplomatic mission, has power too.In the park, Lily and Anna, aged 20 and 22, who get their news from TikTok, echo some of the national messages of pride spread by Chinese state media when it comes to this competitive relationship.“Our country is a very prosperous and powerful country,” they say, dressed in their national costumes. They love China, they said, although they also adore the Avengers and particularly Captain America.Taylor Swift is on their playlists too. Others like 17-year-old Lucy hope to study in America one day.As she cycles on an exercise bike, newly installed in the park, she dreams about visiting Universal Studios one day - after her graduation.Lucy says she is excited to see there is a female candidate. “Harris’s candidacy marks an important step forward for gender equality, and it’s encouraging to see her as a presidential candidate.”Can Xi fix China's economy?The People’s Republic of China has never had a female leader and not a single woman currently sits on the 24-member team known as the Politburo that makes up the most senior members of the Chinese Communist Party.Lucy is also worried about the intense competition between the two countries and believes the best way for China and the United States to improve their relationship is to have more people-to-people exchanges.Both sides have vowed to work towards this, and yet the number of US students studying in China has fallen from around 15,000 in 2011 to 800. Xi hopes to open the door for 50,000 American students to come to China in the next five years. But in a recent interview with the BBC, the US ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, accused parts of the Chinese government of not taking this pledge seriously.He said that on dozens of occasions the security forces or a government ministry have prevented Chinese citizens from participating in public diplomacy run by the US.On the other side, Chinese students and academics have reported being unfairly targeted by US border officials.Lucy, however, remains optimistic that she will be able to travel to America one day, to promote Chinese culture. And, as the music strikes up nearby, she urges Americans to visit and experience China.“We may be a little bit reserved sometimes and not as outgoing or as extrovert as US people, but we are welcoming,” she says as she heads off to join her family.BBC photographs by Xiqing Wang Between now and the US election on 5 November, BBC correspondents in other parts of the world will be exploring the impact its outcome could have where they are, and what people around the globe make of this White House race",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4zpy3zj7ro
