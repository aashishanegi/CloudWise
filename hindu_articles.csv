Who gets the preferred symbol when there are two factions? | Explained,"The story so far: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) founder Sharad Pawar has filed a plea in the Supreme Court, seeking a direction to restrain the Ajit Pawar faction from using the ‘clock’ symbol in the upcoming assembly polls in Maharashtra. Symbols are allotted to political parties as per the provisions of the Symbols Order by the Election Commission of India (ECI). In the largest democracy where a sizeable population is still illiterate, symbols play a crucial role in canvassing and voting process. A national or State recognised political party has a reserved symbol that is not allotted to any other candidate in any constituency.  The NCP at present is a State recognised party in Maharashtra and Nagaland. In July 2023, there was a split in the NCP with the Ajit Pawar faction claiming the support of 41 MLAs out of 53 in the Maharashtra assembly. The ECI in February 2024 recognised Ajit Pawar faction as the real NCP and allotted to it the ‘clock’ symbol reserved for NCP during the Lok Sabha elections in April-May 2024. The NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar) [NCP(SP)] was allotted a common symbol of ‘man blowing turha.’ The present plea claims that during the Lok Sabha election, voters were confused as to which faction represented the real NCP. The NCP (SP) therefore has sought a direction to freeze the ‘clock’ symbol and allot a new symbol to Ajit Pawar faction.  As per the Symbols Order, in case of split in a recognised political party, the ECI decides as to which faction or group is the recognised political party. It allots the reserved symbol to such faction. However, the ECI has also frozen symbols in the past before determining the dispute. The ‘two leaves’ symbol of the AIADMK party in Tamil Nadu was frozen in January 1989 and April 2017 due to competing claims. The ‘bow and arrow’ symbol of Shiv Sena was also frozen before a bye-election in October 2022.  The Supreme Court in Sadiq Ali versus the ECI (1971), laid down the 3-test formula for determining which faction is to be recognised as the original political party. These are the aims and objectives of the party; its affairs as per the party’s constitution that reflect inner party democracy; and majority in the legislative and organisation wings. The ECI in its order in February 2024 held that there was no dispute between the two factions on the first test and that neither of the factions followed the party’s constitution rendering the second test redundant. Since the organisational election of NCP in the year 2022 was shrouded with doubt, it went on to decide the issue solely based on majority in the legislature as a majority of legislators supported the Ajit Pawar faction.  However, in the Maharashtra Lok Sabha elections, the NCP (SP) faction despite fighting with its new symbol won eight seats as against just one seat won by the NCP led by Ajit Pawar that fought on its traditional ‘clock’ symbol. The Supreme Court generally does not interfere in the poll process as it is the domain of the ECI. Nevertheless, in exceptional circumstances, it has given directions to the ECI for ensuring a fair election process. In the instant case, because of the performance of the NCP (SP) in the recent Lok Sabha election, the third test of legislative majority can again be disputed. The decision of the ECI to recognise the Ajit Pawar faction as the real NCP has also been challenged in the SC by NCP(SP). Considering these factors, the court may direct the ECI to freeze the ‘clock’ symbol for the assembly elections to be held in November 2024. The real reform required is institutionalising internal democracy through regular inner-party elections in our political parties. Various experts are of the view that the ECI should not be involved in monitoring these elections as it will drag a constitutional authority into the muddle of party politics. It is the members of various political parties as responsible citizenry who need to demand and operationalise such internal democracy.

A critical message for the urban elite,"In India, this year’s summer shattered records, with red alerts issued nationwide. Over 200 lives were lost to heatwaves (official), but countless more went unrecorded. Delhi experienced an unprecedented 50+°C. With the progress of the monsoon and the memory of the extreme heat far behind us, we risk ignoring a critical warning. In the last decade, urban areas in India have faced increasingly severe and frequent heatwaves, largely due to the urban heat island (UHI) effect. This phenomenon, where cities are significantly warmer than their rural counterparts, is driven by carbon-emitting human activities. Urban design exacerbates this effect, with concrete, asphalt, and glass structures retaining heat. In corporate hubs such as Gurugram, sleek glass buildings, while modern and attractive, trap heat and increase energy consumption. The reflections from these buildings and the lack of green cover further worsen conditions for those outside. The severity of these issues demands immediate attention, as poor urban planning disproportionately affects marginalised communities. Delivery boys, who navigate city streets to meet the demand for online orders, face relentless heat with little relief. Auto drivers are directly exposed to the scorching heat of the day as they strive to earn a living. So do construction workers who are forced to work long hours outdoors, enduring the hot sun without adequate shade or hydration. Women domestic workers frequently travel by foot, and street vendors constantly battle the whims of the weather, with their earnings declining as foot traffic reduces due to the heat. These individuals face the harshest consequences of poor urban planning. They are on the front lines, experiencing the direct impact of rising temperatures, poor air quality, and the scarcity of green spaces.  Poor urban planning remains unchecked in part because the privileged, who have more influence, are less affected. And technology is enabling this by lulling us into inaction. In air-conditioned environments, the comforts provided by technology further insulate the privileged from the harsh realities of urban life, diminishing their incentive to push for change. Grocery delivery apps reduce the need to step outside for basic needs. For even minor repairs, we turn to apps for doorstep services, and ride-hailing apps encourage us to take cabs for short distances.  This unintended consequence of our thriving app ecosystem, built on a labour surplus economy, has not been widely discussed in public discourse and warrants a deeper examination for its societal implications.  Our tech-enabled ecosystem has redefined the concept of “luxury”, creating a comfort trap that reduces our motivation to engage with the outside world. It has led to greater human domestication and a detachment from the environment around us. Tech coupled with privilege has also invisibilised labour, which is making us lose our empathy. In service complexes, guards receive deliveries at building gates, reducing our interaction with the people who serve us. In all these instances, a common theme is that the urban elite are willing to pay a premium to trade discomfort for convenience. Unfortunately, the insulation of the upper classes from the external environment has profound implications for urban governance and the local economy.  When the privileged encounter issues such as poor public services or inadequate infrastructure, these problems often gain media attention, prompting governmental action. For instance, the flash storm in Delhi some months ago that led to the flooding of basements in posh areas and even the houses of Members of Parliament in Lutyens’ Delhi. This led to swift action by the authorities.  Similarly, public schools often lack resources because the affluent prefer private institutions. And public transportation receives less focus and funding as the elite avoid using it.  Even more worrisome is the fact that we are entering a vicious cycle. While heatwaves force people indoors, technology enables this behaviour, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy: worsening urban conditions make outdoor engagement unbearable which further increases reliance on technology. As a result, the wealthy demand fewer public service improvements, making cities less liveable for everyone.  The broader societal implications of this change are alarming. As technology is integrating further into our lives, it is reshaping our expectations of urban living. But this integration is not improving the quality of life for the general populace. Instead, it is aggravating existing inequalities and creating new ones.  The real challenge lies in breaking free from this comfort trap. Reconnecting with our cities and each other is not just a noble goal; it is essential for our collective survival. We have to snap out of our false sense of comfort and recognise that our world is changing in fundamental ways. We are losing our public spaces and our ability to enjoy outdoor activities due to increasingly frequent extreme weather events. The urban elite must, therefore, leverage their privilege to actively engage with governments and help improve living conditions in our cities. Only by confronting the true state of our urban areas can we hope to rebuild them as equitable, liveable spaces for all.  Let us not let convenience become the architect of the demise of our cities.

West Asia conflict LIVE: Israeli strike on hospital tent camp kills 4 and ignites a fire that burns dozens,"The UN on Monday (October 14, 2024) stressed the urgent need for ceasefires in both Lebanon and Gaza to avert a broader regional conflict with ramifications for the whole world. “A ceasefire that is sustained by a meaningful peace process... is the only way to break the cycle of violence, of hatred, of misery,” said UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi. A Hezbollah drone attack on an army base in central Israel killed four soldiers and severely wounded seven others Sunday (October 13, 2024), the military said. Israel also vowed for ‘forceful response’ to Hezbollah’s attack on its army base.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/west-asia-conflict-israel-lebanon-hezbollah-live-updates-october-14-2024/article68751072.ece
‘Scorpion on the Shivling’ case: SC extends stay on defamation proceedings against Shashi Tharoor,"A Supreme Court Bench headed by Justice Hrishikesh Roy on Monday (October 14, 2024) extended the stay granted on September 9 on criminal defamation proceedings initiated against Congress MP Shashi Tharoor in connection with his reference to “scorpion sitting on a Shivling” in connection with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The court allowed Additional Solicitor General Raja Thakare, appearing for the NCT of Delhi, to file a response or a synopsis in the case. The court also allowed the lawyer appearing for the complainant to file his vakalatnama before adjourning the case. 
Also read | Fact check: Did Shashi Tharoor compare Narendra Modi to a scorpion on a Shivling? In the previous hearing, the court had orally observed whether a metaphor suggesting “invincibility’”, could be found objectionable. “Eventually, it [scorpion sitting on a Shivling] is a metaphor… The metaphor may refer to the invincibility of the person who is being spoken about… ‘Scorpion on a Shivling’ - can the metaphor not be understood as something pointing to the invincibility of the person? A metaphor is a figure of speech… A metaphor is capable of telling the truth or the view of the author of the metaphor by occupying the least space… Like a picture can take the place of 1000 words, if good enough a metaphor can substitute 1000 words… Don’t know why somebody has taken objection here,” Justice Roy had observed. The apex court Bench had spared Mr. Tharoor from appearing before a trial court on September 10.  The defamation case is based on a complaint filed by BJP leader Rajiv Babbar against Mr. Tharoor in November 2018. The complaint accused the Congress MP from Kerala of quoting an unnamed RSS functionary featured in a Caravan magazine story from March 2012. Mr. Tharoor, while speaking about his book ‘The Paradoxical Prime Minister: Narendra Modi and his India’ at the Bangalore Lit Fest in October 2018, had referred to the “extraordinarily striking metaphor” used by the anonymous RSS member. “The man [unnamed RSS source] says Mr. Modi is like a scorpion sitting on a Shivling . You cannot remove him with your hand and you cannot hit with a chappal either. And If you think about it, that’s a very very profound understanding of the relationship. Because if you try to remove a scorpion with your hand, you will get stung yourself badly. If you hit the Shivling with chappal, then you undermine all the sacred tenets of the faith that you hold (on Shivling) on which scorpion is sitting,” Mr. Tharoor had reportedly said. The Congress MP had approached the top court against the refusal of the Delhi High Court on August 29, 2024 to quash the defamation proceedings. The High Court had asked him to appear before the Judicial Magistrate concerned on September 10. Advocate Mohammed Ali Khan, appearing for Mr. Tharoor, had submitted that no defamation case was registered for six years, between 2012 and 2018, after the ‘scorpion sitting on the Shivling’ comment was published. Mr. Babbar had countered that he was aware of the magazine article, but had found it of “no consequence” in 2012. He chose to react only after Mr. Tharoor raked it up to dampen the growing popularity of Mr. Modi and the BJP with the passage of time. The lawyer had referred to Section 199(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure to contend that a defamation case could be instituted only by the aggrieved person. “Members of a political party cannot be the ‘aggrieved person’ under Section 199,” Mr. Khan had argued. He had said Mr. Tharoor’s statement was made in good faith and would come within the ambit of the exceptions to Section 499 (criminal defamation) of the Indian Penal Code.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/scorpion-on-the-shivling-case-sc-extends-stay-on-defamation-proceedings-against-shashi-tharoor/article68752031.ece

Three share Economics Nobel for research into differences in prosperity between nations,"The Nobel memorial prize in economics has been awarded to Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James A. Robinson for research into differences in prosperity between nations. The three economists “have demonstrated the importance of societal institutions for a country’s prosperity,” the Nobel committee of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said. “Societies with a poor rule of law and institutions that exploit the population do not generate growth or change for the better. The laureates’ research helps us understand why,” it added. The announcement was made Monday in Stockholm. Acemoglu and Johnson work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Robinson conducts his research at the University of Chicago. The economics prize is formally known as the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. The central bank established it in 1968 as a memorial to Nobel, the 19th-century Swedish businessman and chemist who invented dynamite and established the five Nobel Prizes. Though Nobel purists stress that the economics prize is technically not a Nobel Prize, it is always presented together with the others on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel’s death in 1896. The Nobel Prize 2024: An interactive guide The economics prize wraps up this year’s Nobel season, which honoured achievements in artificial intelligence for the physics and chemistry prizes, while the Peace Prize went to Japanese group Nihon Hidankyo, committed to fighting nuclear weapons. The 2024 Nobel Prize in physics went to John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton “for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks.” The 2024 Nobel Prize for chemistry was shared by David Baker “for computational protein design” along with Demis Hassabis and John Jumper “for protein structure prediction.” South Korea’s Han Kan won the literature prize — the only woman laureate so far this year — while the medicine prize lauded discoveries in understanding gene regulation. The Nobel Prizes consist of a diploma, a gold medal and a one-million-dollar lump sum. They will be presented at ceremonies in Stockholm and Oslo on December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of scientist and prize creator Alfred Nobel.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/economics-nobel-prize-2024-awarded-to-daron-acemoglu-simon-johnson-and-james-a-robinson/article68751672.ece
